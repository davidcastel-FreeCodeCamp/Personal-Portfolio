# FreeCodeCamp - Personal-Portfolio Project

This is my project for FreeCodeCamp :computer:

<p>
  The lesson was called <em> "Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage"</em>
  The purpose of the project was to create a personal porfolio that has my either my Gitub linked or FCC account linked. The website is also meant to showcase the projects that I have worked on in the pass. 
  <br>
  <the site is small enough to fullfill the requirements of the project.
